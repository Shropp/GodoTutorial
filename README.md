# GodoTutorial
This is a tutorial repo for some friends on some Godot basics.





# Getting Set Up
There's a few tools you'll need to have downloaded and ready before we get started.
## Downloading the Engine/Dependencies
First thing's first, you need to download the game engine. <br>Go to [this page](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) and **download the .NET version of Godot**, circled in red below.<br><br>

The game engine comes in a zip folder, so extract it to somewhere more permanent (or don't, I'm not your mom).

Next you will want to go to the [.NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and get .NET 8.0 by clicking the .NET SDK x64 button, then following the installation instructions. (I didn't end up needing the command line stuff)<br><br>

## GitHub
GitHub Desktop is a great way to manage versions of projects. This will allow us to work independently and keep projects consistent between one another. [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and follow the installation instructions.<br><br>

You can also use command-line git if that makes you happier.

## (Optional) Visual Studio Code
Godot has a built-in editor that works fine, but if you're like me and you want to use something a little more portable, then there is VSCode support. You can download VSCode and follow the installation instructions.<br><br>

Here is a [good video](https://youtu.be/egtBFbWz7N4?si=qkvJw5ZxDrjRuPw9) on how to get VSCode set up, as well as general installation instructions. I noticed the only discrepancy here was in the editor settings, where I had to paste in the path to my VSCode.
